    // Hello!
    // My streets are modeled to look like a circuitboard - hopefully that is clear haha. All roads are generated via code, and not prefab.
    // The roads used to be all primitives, but I changed them per requirements to be flat meshes. They are indeed layered, just with VERY precise
    // numbers, so it looks flush with the green base. 
    // The 32 Vertex requirement is fulfilled by the circular "roundabouts" on the dead ends, which is made via script.
    // Adjust seed in streetmaker.
    // Camera control is custom, let me know if it gives you any trouble.
    // Have a lovely day whoever is grading this.
